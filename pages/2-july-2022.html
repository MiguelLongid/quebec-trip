    <p>The trip to Montreal went very well. Mty father and I travelled from our campsite to London, which took around 1 hour and 10 minutes. When we arrived at the London VIA rail terminal, we got together with the rest of the exchange group and waited for our train. My father left at around this time. Once the train arrived, we boarded and left for Toronto, which took around 2 hours. Once we arrived, we had a bit of time to kill, so me and another groupmate went out to get something to eat. It was my first time walking around downton Toronto, and I must say I was very impressed. The buildings were massive and the streets were so lively. I would not mind living in a place like that. After we grabbed a bite, we went back and boarded our train to Montreal. The ride there was not the most pleasant, as the seats were upright which prevented comfortable sleeping positions. However, I did not mind too much. After around 10 hours, we finally arrived in Montreal.</p>
    <p>As for Montreal, my first impression of it is very good. It is a very big and modernized city, which left me in awe when I first arrived. The buildings are grand, the downtown area is very lively, and the streets seem quite clean compared to Windsor. I really would love to explore Montreal sometime in the near future. I was picked up by Christine, my host mother, as well as Laurence and Camille, two of her daughters. They had a welcoming sign for me and were very kind when first meeting me. After a bit of small talk and picture taking, we headed off to their house.</p>
    <p>Just to add some context: I have two host families in this exchange (the parents are divorced and live in separate houses). The mother's name is Christine and the father's name is Dennis. I will be alternating living with both every week, starting with the mother's house. I arrived at my host mother's home at around 10:30 PM and have since settled in. From the outside, their house is quite big and looks nice. Inside, the house seems very comfortable and complete. I would love to live in a house like this.</p>
